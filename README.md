## Project Overview

For this mini-project, we selected a trailer of an upcoming game called **Monster Hunter Wilds**. The main objective was to edit the audio using Audacity to alter the overall tone and meaning of the trailer without modifying the video. Our approach was to transform the original theme of the trailer from **action** into **terror and suspense** through strategic audio manipulation.
