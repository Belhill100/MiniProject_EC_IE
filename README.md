## Project Overview

For this mini-project, we selected a trailer of an upcoming game called **Monster Hunter Wilds**. The main objective was to edit the audio using Audacity to alter the overall tone and meaning of the trailer without modifying the video. Our approach was to transform the original theme of the trailer from **action** into **terror and suspense** through strategic audio manipulation.

## Methodology

### Audio Extraction
We began by extracting the audio track from the trailer video using **Online Audio Converter**. This allowed us to work exclusively with the audio file in Audacity.

### Editing Process in Audacity
In Audacity, we utilized a variety of audio editing tools to achieve our goal:
- **Frequency Modulation:** We altered the pitch and frequency of certain sounds to change the emotional impact of specific scenes.
- **Time Stretching/Compression:** Adjustments to the timing and tempo of the audio were made to influence the pacing of the trailer.
- **Volume Control:** We modified the volume levels to emphasize or de-emphasize particular elements of the soundscape.
- **Sound Effects Addition/Removal:** Certain sounds were either introduced or removed to fit the new tone.
- **Reordering Audio Clips:** We rearranged segments of the audio to support the new narrative we were creating.

### Audio and Video Integration
Once the audio editing was completed, we used **OpenShot** to replace the original audio in the trailer with our edited version. This step ensured that the video remained unchanged while the audio provided a completely different context.

## Justification

The decision to transform the trailer from a **Action Game** to a **Misterious and Suspense Game** was made to showcase the versatility of sound in shaping the viewer's perception. By altering key audio components—such as pitch, tempo, and effects—we aimed to demonstrate how audio can drastically change the mood and storytelling of visual content. Our editing choices were carefully crafted to maintain the trailer's coherence while providing a contrasting interpretation of the visuals.
